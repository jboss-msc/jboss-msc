        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            This is the documentation overview page for the Modular Service Container (MSC) project.  MSC is divided
            into several functional categories, each of which is defined in its own separate package.  To get started,
            begin with the <a href="org/jboss/msc/service/package-summary.html"><code>org.jboss.msc.service</code></a>
            package, which implements the container itself.
