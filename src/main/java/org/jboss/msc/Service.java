/**
 * A service is a thing which can be started and stopped.
 * A service may be started or stopped from any thread.
 * <p id="thread-safety">
 * Service implementation should always take care to protect any mutable state appropriately; however, the following
 * thread-safety properties and relationships are always guaranteed:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Dependency service start operations always <em>happen-before</em> dependent service start operations</li>
 *     <li>Dependent service stop operations always <em>happen-before</em> dependency service stop operations</li>
 *     <li>Memory which is modified within a dependency service start operation will be visible to dependents (even if the writes
 *     are to non-volatile fields or were otherwise unprotected by locks or other memory barriers)</li>
 * </ul>
 * In general, services do not need to concern themselves with thread safety unless they contain state which can be used
 * or manipulated outside of the service dependency graph and lifecycle operations.
 * <p>
 * Service implementations may provide multiple values to their consumers.
 * <p>
 * Lifecycle operations may block as necessary.  Note that if enough concurrent service lifecycles are blocking, it is possible
 * that the thread pool will fill and no further lifecycle operations can complete until some of the existing lifecycle operations
 * complete.
 * <p>
 * It is important that lifecycle operations do not perform tasks that will block infinitely.  One example of such a task
 * would be a stop method which calls {@link System#exit(int)}.  Such a task will never complete, causing the service container
 * to never shut down, which in turn may cause the JVM to never exit, resulting in permanent deadlock.
 * <p>
 * It is also important that services not block on conditions which may only be resolved by other services. Such situations
 * must always be modeled as service dependencies to ensure correct operation and prevent a deadlock.
 * <p>
 * Lifecycle operations which are naturally asynchronous should consider use of the {@link LifecycleContext#asynchronous()} API
 * in order to increase parallelism and reduce resource consumption.  Examples of such operations include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Operations which run in the background and signal completion via a callback</li>
 *     <li>Operations which use a callback-driven {@code Future} variant like {@link CompletableFuture} or {@link AsyncFuture}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Lifecycle operations which can benefit from parallel execution of work should consider use of the {@link LifecycleContext#execute(Runnable)}
 * API in combination with the asynchronous API.  This can allow many threads to work in parallel to complete the lifecycle step.
