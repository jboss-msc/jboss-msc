/**
 * A stability monitor statistics. Allows to collect statistics data
 * about {@link ServiceController}s registered with {@link StabilityMonitor} object.
 * The following data are available:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>count of controllers in <b>ACTIVE</b> mode - see method {@link #getActiveCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers that <b>FAILED</b> to start - see method {@link #getFailedCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers in <b>LAZY</b> mode - see method {@link #getLazyCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers in <b>NEVER</b> mode - see method {@link #getNeverCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers in <b>ON_DEMAND</b> mode - see method {@link #getOnDemandCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers in <b>PASSIVE</b> mode - see method {@link #getPassiveCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers that had <b>PROBLEM</b> to start - see method {@link #getProblemsCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers in <b>UP</b> state - see method {@link #getStartedCount()}</li> 
 *   <li>count of controllers in <b>REMOVE</b> mode - see method {@link #getRemovedCount()}</li> 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Sample usage:
 * <pre>
 * StabilityMonitor monitor = ...
 * <b>StabilityStatistics statistics = new StabilityStatistics();</b>
 * monitor.awaitStability(<b>statistics</b>);
 * // do something with <b>statistics</b> object.
 * </pre>
